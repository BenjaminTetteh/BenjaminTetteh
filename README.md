## üîê Cyber Security Projects I have done:
* **[Analyze a vulnerable system for a small business:](https://github.com/BenjaminTetteh/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/blob/main/Analyze%20a%20vulnerable%20system%20for%20a%20small%20business.pdf)** I conducted a vulnerability assessment for a small business, evaluated the risks of a vulnerable information system and outlined a remediation plan. NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 was used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.
* **[Conduct a security audit:](https://github.com/BenjaminTetteh/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/blob/main/Conduct%20a%20security%20audit.pdf)** Performed an internal security audit for a fictional company, assessing its security posture, identifying gaps, and recommending improvements to align with PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC standards.
* **[Incident report analysis:](https://github.com/BenjaminTetteh/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/blob/main/Incident%20report%20analysis.pdf)** I created an incident report after analyzing a scenario using the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF). 
* **[Update a file through a Python algorithm:](https://github.com/BenjaminTetteh/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/blob/main/Update%20a%20file%20through%20a%20Python%20algorithm.pdf)** In this project, I was able to open a file, read the contents within the file, write contents within the file, and created an algorithm that updated a file using Python. 
* **[Applying filters to SQL queries:](https://github.com/BenjaminTetteh/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/blob/main/Apply%20filters%20to%20SQL%20queries.pdf)** I used SQL with filters to perform security-related tasks.
* **[Managing Files using Linux commands:](https://github.com/BenjaminTetteh/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/blob/main/File%20permissions%20in%20Linux.pdf)** I used Linux commands to examine existing permissions and modified them if need be, to authorize the appropriate users and removed any unauthorized access.
* **Created a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Using AWS** Designed and deployed a Virtual Private Clouds (VPC) on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and configured virtual machines within the VPC for testing and operational purposes.
* **Security Incident Report** Documented a cybersecurity incident involving a ransomware attack on a healthcare facility.
* **Change converter:** As part of my training from Security Blue Team, I created a python program that converts a given amount of money, expressed in cents, into its equivalent value in dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. 
* **Cybersecurity Lab Environment Setup:** Built a virtual lab using VirtualBox on MacBook Air M2, with KALI Linux, Metasploitable 2, Nessus Essentials, and WPScan for vulnerability management, malware analysis, and log analysis.
* **ANZ Australia Cybersecurity Management Job Simulation (Forage):** Investigated phishing emails and analyzed Packet Capture files using Wireshark and a Hex-editor to identify potential threats.
* **Telstra Cybersecurity Job Simulation (Forage):** Gained experience in malware detection, incident response, and implementing firewalls as part of a Security Operations team.
* **PwC Switzerland Cybersecurity Job Simulation (Forage):** Conducted risk assessments, recommended security strategies, and demonstrated expertise in network segmentation and firewall configuration.
* **Mastercard Cybersecurity Virtual Experience Program (Forage):** Identified and reported phishing threats, assessed areas requiring improved security training, and implemented mitigation procedures.
* **Deloitte Cyber Job Simulation (Forage):** Supported a client in a cyber security breach by examining web activity logs and identifying suspect user behaviour.
